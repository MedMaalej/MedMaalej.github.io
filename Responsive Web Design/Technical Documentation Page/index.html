		<header>So what is HTML?</header>
		<p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
		<code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
		<p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
		<code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
	</section>

	<section id="Attributes" class="main-section">
		<header>Attributes</header>
		<p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.</p>
		<p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
			<li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
			<li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section id="Nesting_Elements" class="main-section">
		<header>Nesting Elements</header>
		<p>You can put elements inside other elements too - this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
		<code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
		<p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element first, then the <span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element; therefore, we have to close the <span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element first, then the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element. The following is incorrect:</p>
		<code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
		<p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
	</section>

	<section id="Images" class="main-section">
		<header>Images</header>
		<p>Let's turn our attention to the <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> element:</p>
		<code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
		<p>This embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
		<p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
			<li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your <span class="code">src</span> attribute to make it incorrect.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>
		<p>Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="Headings" class="main-section">
		<header>Headings</header>
		<p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <span class="code">&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;</span>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
		<code>
			&lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
			&lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
			&lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
			&lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;<br>
		</code>
		<p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span> element.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="Lists" class="main-section">
		<header>Lists</header>
		<p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <span class="code">&lt;ul&gt;</span> element.</li>
			<li><strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <span class="code">&lt;ol&gt;</span> element.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an <span class="code">&lt;li&gt;</span> (list item) element.</p>
		<p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
		<code>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we're a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ... &lt;/p&gt;</code>
		<p>We could modify the markup to this</p>
		<code>
			&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we're a global community of&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>

			&lt;ul&gt;<br>
				&emsp;&lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;<br>
				&emsp;&lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;<br>
				&emsp;&lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;<br>
			&lt;/ul&gt;<br><br>

			&lt;p&gt;working together ... &lt;/p&gt;
		</code>
		<p>Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="Links" class="main-section">
		<header>Links</header>
		<p>Links are very important - they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element - &lt;a&gt; - "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
			<li>
				Wrap the text in an <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> element, as shown below:<br><br>
				<code>&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code><br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Give the <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> element an <span class="code">href</span> attribute, as shown below:<br><br>
				<code>&lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code><br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:<br><br>
				<code>&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the <span class="code">https://</span> or <span class="code">http://</span> part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
		<p>Add a link to your page now, if you haven't already done so.</p>
